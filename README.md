### A Browse Through ES6
#### Jez Higgins

ES6 is (almost) the most recent version of the language most commonly known as Javascript. Its publication in 2015 was the first update to Javascript since 2009 and brought a number of pretty radical revisions to both language and library.

This session takes a look at some of the most significant features, the impact they have on the way we write Javascript, how we can start using them today, why we should, and a look forward to Javascriptâ€™s future evolution.

To build the slides,

```sh
./gradlew asciidoctor
```

The slides use reveal.js, and include speaker notes.  Other backends are available, but probably will come out looking awful.
